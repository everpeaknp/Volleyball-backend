System check identified some issues:

WARNINGS:
?: (ckeditor.W001) django-ckeditor bundles CKEditor 4.22.1 which isn't supported anymore and which does have unfixed security issues, see for example https://ckeditor.com/cke4/release/CKEditor-4.24.0-LTS . You should consider strongly switching to a different editor (maybe CKEditor 5 respectively django-ckeditor-5 after checking whether the CKEditor 5 license terms work for you) or switch to the non-free CKEditor 4 LTS package. See https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4-support/ for more on this. (Note! This notice has been added by the django-ckeditor developers and we are not affiliated with CKSource and were not involved in the licensing change, so please refrain from complaining to us. Thanks.)
